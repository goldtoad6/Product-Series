> [The article](https://www.productcompass.pm/p/prd-template) you've linked to, "How to Write a Product Requirements Document? The Best PRD Template," by Paweł Huryn, provides a comprehensive guide on creating a Product Requirements Document (PRD). Here are the key points and insights from the article:
>
> 1. **Why We Need a PRD**:
>
>    - The PRD is not about documenting "requirements" but rather about providing strategic context and focusing on outcomes.
>    - It's essential for larger initiatives that span over several weeks and need to be communicated effectively to stakeholders.
>
> 2. **What’s Inside a PRD**:
>
>    - **Document Overview**: A brief summary for those who might not read the entire document.
>    - **Stakeholders**: Key individuals involved, such as the Product Manager, Design Lead, and Lead Engineer.
>    - **Communication Channels**: Links to Slack or Teams channels for interested parties.
>    - **Context**: Explanation of the initiative, why it's being built now, and any recent changes or possibilities.
>    - **Objective**: A clear, SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) objective that aligns with the product strategy.
>    - **Success Criteria**: How success will be measured.
>    - **Target Users**: Who the product is being built for and their needs.
>    - **Constraints**: Any limitations such as geographic, language, or regulatory factors.
>    - **Customer Jobs/Needs**: Focus areas for customer needs and how the product will address them.
>    - **Competitive Advantage**: How the product will solve problems better than competitors.
>    - **UX/Prototypes**: Overview of the user experience, including user flow diagrams and links to prototypes.
>    - **Key Features**: List of key features with brief descriptions.
>    - **Technology**: A high-level overview of the technology used, if relevant.
>    - **Assumptions**: Assumptions about value, usability, viability, and feasibility, and how they've been validated.
>    - **Risks**: Accepted risks and mitigation strategies.
>    - **Timeline**: An estimate of the duration and what might be included in the first version.
>
> 3. **When to Write a PRD**:
>
>    - The PRD is an evolving workspace that aggregates key information and supports internal communication. It's particularly useful for documenting product discovery and facilitating alignment within the organization.
>
> 4. **Common Mistakes**:
>
>    - Avoid the waterfall approach where detailed specifications are documented in a heavy, rigid manner.
>    - Keep the PRD concise and avoid overloading it with too much information.
>    - Remember that the PRD should support empowered teams, not hinder them with excessive process.
>
> 5. **PRD Templates**:
>
>    - The article mentions that PRD templates are available in Notion and Google Docs, but the specific templates are locked for subscribers.
>
> 6. **Importance of Alignment**:
>
>    - The PRD should help in aligning the team and stakeholders around a common understanding of the initiative, its objectives, and its expected outcomes.
>
> 7. **Inspiration from Reed Hastings**:
>    - The article references Reed Hastings' philosophy from his book "No Rules Rules," emphasizing the importance of giving employees freedom and avoiding overly rigid processes.
>
> The article emphasizes that the PRD should be a living document that evolves with the project, facilitating communication and alignment rather than serving as a static, detailed specification. It's a tool to support product discovery and implementation, not a constraint.
